job-board-ember-with-node
=========================

This project is an evolution from the Ember front-end created here: https://github.com/krmannix/job-board-ember-front-end
Without disrupting the layout of the ember front end (in case this project might be replicated in other backend libraries or frameworks such as Python's Flask), a new repo was created to support the addition of a node.js back-end.

This tutorial is the initial starting point:
